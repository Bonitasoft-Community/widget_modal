# widget_modal

The Widget Modal button display a button. When you click on the button, then a Modal window appears, and then you can edit something.
<img src="screenshoot_button.jpg"/>

A close button is then accessible to ... close the modal window

To create the content of the modal window, create a new Container, and set inside what you like.
Then, give a code in the CSS : in the example, I gave the code "bob"
<img src="screenshoot_uidesigner.jpg"/>

In the modal button, just reference the code "bob"

At init, the container is then hidden. When you click, the modal is open and then the container is displayed.
